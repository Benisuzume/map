 Packages the `war3map.lua`.  Depending on settings, may optionally build
 the map as well.  If the map is built, then trigger strings will be inlined
 within objects and user build files that have access to an environment
 exposed by Map will be processed.  These can be used to import files,
 create and modify objects, adjust constants, and more.

## Usage
    build [options]
    build <configuration>

## Options
    --version    Displays the version number.
    --help       Displays this help message.]]
